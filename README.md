# What is this and how do I eat it

This here might become a sort of documentation of progress, that's very on and off, of my small roguelike project that started from Python [TCOD Tutorial (2020)](https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/) by [TStand90](https://github.com/TStand90)

And has since continued to grow and change, it's not by any means complete or deemed "playable", at least by myself. And it also definitely isn't very advanced or too differing from the original result you get by doing this tutorial.

However I like tinkering with it and learning new things, thus I truck along with this project slowly forward.

Expect to see a roadmap of sorts for what I have currently planned as a means, mostly for myself, to keep track of ideas and goals to achieve.

You might see some "documentation"-like rambling as I struggle my way through Python and my knowledge of it and try to wrestle both to achieve what I imagined. Which is slow and painful process of bashing things until they do what I want.

For now this will be most likely very empty and barren site but I want to fill it a bit soon.
